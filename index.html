    <h1>Start a New React Project</h1>
    <p>
      If you want to build a new app or a new website fully with React, we
      recommend picking one of the React-powered frameworks popular in the
      community. You can use
      <span class="highlight">React without a framework</span>, however weâ€™ve
      found that most apps and sites eventually build solutions to common
      problems such as code-splitting, routing, data fetching, and
      <span class="highlight">generating HTML</span> . These problems are common
      to all UI libraries, not just React. By starting with a framework, you can
      get started <span class="highlight">with React quickly</span>, and avoid
      essentially building your own framework later.
